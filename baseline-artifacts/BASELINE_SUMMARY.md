# Size-Tracking Baseline - Task Completion Summary

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

This document summarizes the completion of **Step 1: Create a size-tracking baseline** from the project optimization plan.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Clean Build Locally
- Performed a clean build using `pio run -v > build.log`
- Captured detailed build output with memory usage information
- Recorded current memory usage:
  - **RAM**: 17.3% (56,560 bytes used / 327,680 bytes total)
  - **Flash**: 99.3% (1,302,037 bytes used / 1,310,720 bytes total)

### 2. ✅ Captured .elf and .map Files
- Generated and archived `firmware.elf` (20.2 MB)
- Generated and archived `firmware.map` (13.8 MB)
- Both files are now preserved in the `baseline-artifacts/` directory

### 3. ✅ Recorded Flash/RAM Usage
- Created comprehensive memory usage summary in `memory-usage-summary.txt`
- Detailed build log with verbose output shows memory sections
- Identified that Flash memory is nearly full (99.3%), highlighting optimization need

### 4. ✅ GitHub CI Runner Setup
- Created `.github/workflows/size-baseline.yml` workflow
- Configured to trigger on pushes to `size-baseline` branch
- Will capture the same artifacts on GitHub Actions ubuntu-latest runners
- CI artifacts will be uploaded with 90-day retention

### 5. ✅ Committed to size-baseline Branch
- Created new branch `size-baseline` from current state
- Committed all baseline artifacts:
  - `firmware.elf` - Complete firmware binary
  - `firmware.map` - Memory map for detailed analysis
  - `build.log` - Verbose build output (forced add despite .gitignore)
  - `memory-usage-summary.txt` - Human-readable summary
- Pushed branch to origin to trigger CI workflow

## Files Archived for Later Diffing

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `firmware.elf` | 20.2 MB | Complete firmware binary with debug symbols |
| `firmware.map` | 13.8 MB | Memory map showing symbol locations and sizes |
| `build.log` | 159 KB | Verbose build output with memory section details |
| `memory-usage-summary.txt` | 856 B | Human-readable summary of memory usage |

## Critical Measurements Captured

- **Current RAM Usage**: 56,560 bytes (17.3% of 327,680 bytes)
- **Current Flash Usage**: 1,302,037 bytes (99.3% of 1,310,720 bytes)
- **Available Flash**: Only 8,683 bytes remaining (0.7%)
- **Build Environment**: ttgo-lora32-v1 (ESP32)
- **Git Commit**: faae3e0d8deeaebde633c6fe64fd03a4eff1e3f5

## Next Steps

This baseline provides the foundation for objective measurement of all future optimization steps. Each subsequent step can now be measured against this baseline using:

1. **Memory Usage Comparison**: Compare RAM/Flash percentages
2. **Map File Diffing**: Use `firmware.map` to identify which symbols/sections changed
3. **Build Log Analysis**: Compare verbose build outputs to track compilation changes
4. **Automated CI Tracking**: GitHub Actions will capture equivalent baselines

## Usage Instructions

To compare future builds against this baseline:

```bash
# Compare memory usage
grep "RAM:\|Flash:" baseline-artifacts/build.log
grep "RAM:\|Flash:" current-build.log

# Diff memory maps
diff baseline-artifacts/firmware.map .pio/build/ttgo-lora32-v1/firmware.map

# Compare ELF files
size baseline-artifacts/firmware.elf
size .pio/build/ttgo-lora32-v1/firmware.elf
```

The size-baseline branch is now ready for use as the reference point for all future optimization measurements.
