MEMORY USAGE:
- RAM:   17.3% (used 56,560 bytes from 327,680 bytes)
- Flash: 99.3% (used 1,302,037 bytes from 1,310,720 bytes)

AVAILABLE MEMORY:
- Free RAM: 271,120 bytes (82.7%)
- Free Flash: 8,683 bytes (0.7%)

FILES ARCHIVED:
- firmware.elf: Complete firmware binary
- firmware.map: Memory map file for analysis
- build.log: Verbose build output with detailed memory sections

USAGE:
This baseline can be used to compare memory usage changes in future builds.
Use the firmware.map file to analyze memory layout changes.
Compare build.log files to identify which components contribute to size changes.
